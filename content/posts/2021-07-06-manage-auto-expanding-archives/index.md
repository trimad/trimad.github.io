Managing auto-expanding archives via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps">ExchangeOnlineManagement</a> module is a pain in my ass. This Github Gist is an aggregate of scripts I've written that allow me to administrate this mailbox feature effectively.
