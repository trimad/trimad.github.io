summary: "The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe the population growth of a species over time. It is a simple equation that takes into account the effects of limited resources and environmental factors on population growth. The logistic map produces a pattern of population growth that exhibits chaotic behavior as the values of the model's parameters change, making it a valuable tool for studying complex systems."

The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe the population growth of a species over time. It is a simple equation that takes into account the effects of limited resources and environmental factors on population growth. The logistic map produces a pattern of population growth that exhibits chaotic behavior as the values of the model's parameters change, making it a valuable tool for studying complex systems.

This video was the inspiration for my writing a C# implementation of the Logistic Map:
