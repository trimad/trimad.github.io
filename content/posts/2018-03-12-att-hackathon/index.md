So I participated in the AT&T Hackathon this year. I approached it as R&D for developing 3D games that run on Android. I
don't have much to say about it except that I learned an awful lot about the limitations of Android, which in turn
taught me a lot about optimization techniques, DPI-scaling and the matrix stack. Most importantly, the Hackathon taught
me how to code faster. At home, I spend an awful lot of time playing with variables to make things pretty whereas under
this circumstance I was forced to keep creating new features due to the looming threat of having nothing to show at the
end. I wrote a lot of useful functions for building 3D scenes and I can't wait to start using them on larger projects.
