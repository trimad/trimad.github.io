summary: This program works by creating a grid of evenly-spaced points. Each points has a corresponding object that rotates about that point and is assigned characteristics such as rotation radius, shape, and color that corresponds to the same x and y position of a source image. The phase of each object's rotation to the brightness value of the source image's corresponding pixel. This project taught me a lot about JavaScript and made for some fun animations.
